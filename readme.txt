Clean old tags and options of these plugins: Simple Tagging, Ultimate Tag Warrior, Bunny's Technorati Tags, Jerome's Keywords 1.9 and 2.0 beta

== Description ==

WordPress 2.3 includes built-in tag support. It also, supplies import from the 4 most used plugins: Simple Tagging Plugin, Ultimate Tag Warrior, Bunny's Technorati Tags and Jerome Keywords.
Unfortunately, once the import is done, old tables still remain in the database. To relief your base and significantly improve the performances of your blog, this plugin allows you to clean all the remainings of these plugins.

It is compatible with WordPress from 2.1 to 2.6 version (I've done this plugin for WP 2.3, but you can as well use it with a previous version of WordPress).
Once installed, the plugin page is in 'Manage' menu. You can deleted it when your database is cleaned.

== Installation ==

The Clean Old Tags can be installed in 3 easy steps:
* Unzip "Clean Old Tags" archive and put all files into your "plugins" folder (/wp-content/plugins/) or to create a sub directory into the plugins folder (recommanded), like /wp-content/plugins/clean-old-tags/
* Activate the plugin
* Inside the Wordpress admin, go to Manage > Clean old tags, check the parameters according to your needs, and start the cleaner.
